\altchapter{\bf{Abstract}}
API documentation presents both a problem and an opportunity for API usability. REST APIs provide interconnectivity between applications over HTTP. Documentation of a REST API is a key information source for API client developers. Most REST APIs are documented using a manual approach, which can be time consuming and error-prone. REST API developers need to efficiently document their APIs with the qualities that make the API usable. In this research I focused on the topic of automated REST API documentation to satisfy this need.

In this thesis, I present and evaluate of a novel technique to solve REST API documentaiton requirements. I present a set of REST API documentation requirements by studying the existing literature and the current industry practice. From this study, I observed that REST APIs evolve frequently, but used a manual or bespoke approach for generating and maintaining their documentation. I present a reusable technique with a prototype implementation to automate the REST API documentation process with executable API usage examples. The technique involves the interception of example REST API calls using an HTTP proxy server to auto-generate an accurate and updated REST API documentation. I present an industrial evaluation of the proposed technique based on a period of eighteen months of production use. From this study, I found that it was feasible to leverage API test code to automatically generate an always-updated REST API documentation for evolving REST APIs with usage examples. To evaluate the impact of usage examples on REST API client developers, I performed a controlled study with experienced REST API developers. From this case study, I found that REST API client developers faced patterns of obstacles using REST APIs that can be reduced by including API usage examples in the API documentation, as suggested in the proposed technique.

The findings of this research can be used as a guideline by practitioners to automatically generate an updated REST API documentation with usage examples. Researchers can extend the novel concept of using interception to automatically document API usage examples from test scripts to other forms of APIs.

\chapter{Conclusion}

In this thesis, I presented a novel idea of using interception to automate the process of REST API documentation with usage examples from executable code. I started by investigating the current industry practices and challenges associated with developing and maintaining evolving Web APIs. I found modern Web APIs predominently embraced REST architectural style, but the existing literature had primarily focused on solving problems related to the SOAP APIs. I also found that most REST APIs are documented using manual approaches that are time consuming and error- prone to maintain when an API evolves several times a month. Through my research, I aimed to fill this gap between the REST API documentation challenges and the existing literature by finding a reusable solution to the common problems.


In my second study, I investigated the existing literature on API usablity to derive a set of re- quirements that are applicable to REST API documentation and proposed an idea of automatically generating and maintaining REST API documentation from executable code. I found that existing techniques for REST API documentation systems relied on custom API description languagees that are manually maintained as a parallel artifact to the API code, causing potential drift between the actual API and its documentation as it evolves over time. By using interception, I have demon- strated that it is possible to automatically record and synthesize the recorded API traffic to generate pragmatic REST API documentation from its test code. Additionally, the technique allows API de- velopers to collaboratively document the API with realistic and executable examples for multiple versions as the API evolves.

In my third study, I evaluated the proposed technique in an industrial setup and found it to be a pragmatic solution for production use. The concept of leveraging API tests to maintain an always-updated API documentation has helped the organization establish a quick feedback loop during the API development process. Practitioners can incorporate the findings from this study to improve their own REST API documentation practice.

To understand the impact of usage examples that can be derived from API tests, I performed the last study with professional software engineers and found that the examples help reduce the common obstacles faced by REST API client developers. I derived a list of recommendations for documenting usage examples to satisfy the common information needs when REST API client developers use an API. Practitiones can follow the recommendations as guideline to allocate ap- propriate priority while documenting their REST APIs in a resource constrained environment.

\section{Future Work}
Based on my findings from the this research, I identified the following list of potential future research problems.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Extension to Support Complex Usage Scenarios.} Future research needs to be carried out to find techniques to automate the process of documenting usage scenarios that require multiple API calls to perform complex API tasks. Future research is also needed to investigate techniques for automatically cross-referencing API elements to allow API client developers with an improved navigation experience while reading the REST API documentation.
  \item \textbf{Automated Changelog Generation.} For frequently evolving APIs, future research needs to extend the proposed technique in this thesis to automatically compute human readable changelogs and detect version compatibility to follow a semantic versioning scheme. This would help API client developers with an accurate information about the potential impact of an API update on their own application.
  \item \textbf{Automated API Client Code Generation.} Several tools exist that can convert custom REST API description files to API client code in multiple programming languages. Future research can be carried out to map the SpyREST data model with the custom API description languages to leverage the interception technique to reduce the amount of manual effort required to maintain the custom formatted API descriptions as the API evolves.
  \item \textbf{Extensions of the Interception Based Documentation to non-REST APIs.} The proposed technique can be extended to document usage examples for other stateless APIs outside the realm of REST APIs. The structure of REST APIs are commonly documented using programming language features and formatted comments. Future research can investigate the feasibility of leveraging the interception technique to source realistic usage examples for local stateless APIs from existing API test code.
